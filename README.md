# SQL Projects

Contains folders with following presentations:
 
Churn Rate Project: Four months into launching Codeflix, management asks me to look into subscription churn rate.
It’s early on in the business and people are excited to know how the company is doing. 

Gaming Data with Twich: In this project, you will be working with two tables that contain Twitch users’ stream viewing data and chat room usage data.


Marketing Attribution: CoolTShirts sells shirts of all kinds, as long as they are T-shaped and cool.
Recently, CTS started a few marketing campaigns to increase website visits and purchases.
Using touch attribution, they’d like to map their customers’ journey: from initial visit to purchase.
They can use that information to optimize their marketing campaigns. 

Funnels: In this project, I will analyze different Warby Parker’s marketing funnels in order to calculate conversion rates.
